ws-simple-server

When I was looking for information on how to code a websocket server but
all that I found was large and compex packages.
(Why do so many programmers try to solve all problems in the world in all packages?!)

What I was looking for was something that would just show me the concept in an easy way.

So here some code if you like me just like to get the basic concept.

The first example is in php because it gives easy and pretty understandeble code.
I also made a python and java that I will put here later if requested.
