ws-simple-server

When I was looking for information on how to code a websocket server all I found was large and compex packages.
(Why do so many programmers try to solv all problems in the world in all package?!)

To start I just liked to get the concept but there where of websockets but there where 
very lite information to find.

So my iead here is to do just that show you the concept and then when you understand that 
you can make your own implementation of it.

The first example is in php because it gives easy and pretty understandeble code.
I also made a python and java that I will put here later if requested.
